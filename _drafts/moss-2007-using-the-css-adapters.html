<p>After seeing <a href="#">Frank van Rooijen</a>'s guide to implementing CSS Friendly Adapters into SharePoint 2007, I had to get it running - table-rendered menus make baby jesus cry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no matter how hard I tried; they would render as DIVs, ignoring the browser file. The workaround I eventually came up with was to create an App_Browsers folder in the site's file system root folder (c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\81 for me) and putting the browser file in there. Hooray it works! Now lets just go into central administration and... oh, it worked there too. That's less great.</p>
<p>Turns out CSS'erising the SharePoint administration screens without updating the styles kinda makes it look funky:</p>
