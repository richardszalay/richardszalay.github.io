<p>I made a tough decision when releasing Build Scout on whether to make it free or not. In the end, I decided to charge for it (see below for why)</p>
<p>To make myself feel better about it, I've decided to create a series of posts on how I solved various issues during the app's development. These will include reasoning and source code snippets, and will hopefully help others facing similar issues.</p>
