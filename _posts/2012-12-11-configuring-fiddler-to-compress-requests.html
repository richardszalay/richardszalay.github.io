<p>Applying Content-Encoding headers to a request is tricky subject. While it's part of the HTTP specification, there's no way to determine if a server supports it ahead of time since no communication occurs before a request. Still if the server/client are controlled, request encoding can come in handy for certain scenarios. One such scenario that's becoming more common is uploading log data from a mobile application.</p>
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/">Fiddler</a> to debug your HTTP, you might have spotted that there's no way to compress the request body. Fortunately, since Fiddler is so extensible, adding support is easy.</p>
<p>First up, open the CustomRules script by selecting "Customize Rules..." from the Edit menu (or by pressing CTRL+R).</p>
<p>Now paste the following code just before the lines adding RulesStringValue entries for each browser (around Line 50 of an uncustomised script):</p>
{% highlight js %}
// Request GZip encoding<br />
public static RulesOption("Apply GZIP Encoding to Request")
var m_gzipRequest: boolean = false;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Next, paste the following code at the end of OnBeforeRequest(), right after the "if (m_AlwaysFresh &amp;&amp; ...)" block (around Line 210):</p>
{% highlight js %}
if (m_gzipRequest && oSession.requestBodyBytes != null &&
    oSession.requestBodyBytes.length > 0 && !oSession.oRequest.headers["Content-Encoding"])
{
    oSession.requestBodyBytes = Utilities.GzipCompress(oSession.requestBodyBytes);
    oSession.oRequest.headers["Content-Length"] = oSession.requestBodyBytes.Length.ToString();
    oSession.oRequest.headers["Content-Encoding"] = "gzip";
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now whenever you want request bodies to be compressed, check "Apply GZIP Encoding to Request" from the Rules menu. Don't forget to turn it off again!</p>
