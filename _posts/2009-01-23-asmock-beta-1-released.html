<p>I've just released a beta of ASMock, the dynamic mocking framework for ActionScript 3 that I've been working on. The API should be familiar to users of <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">Rhino Mocks</a> as it is a port of it (albeit with some changes).</p>
<p>More information can be found at the <a href="http://asmock.sourceforge.net">ASMock homepage</a></p>
