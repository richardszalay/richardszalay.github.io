<p>I came across some curious behavior when trying to debug an IIS extension that I'm working on. When I went to select "InetMgr.exe" as the startup program, it wasn't there. I checked the folder using Windows Explorer and, sure enough, there it was. Even entering the path manually resulted in "The external program cannot be found".</p>
<p>So, what was the problem? Well, as far as I can tell, it appears that because InetMgr.exe is an auto-elevated process it is only accessible to other auto-elevated processes. This is quite possibly a post RC solution to the <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090130/uac-security-flaw-windows-7-beta-proof/">flaw in UAC</a> found during the betas, though I'm just speculating.</p>
<p>Luckily, with a bit of experimenting, I was able to find a solution. By enabling remote debugging ("Use remote machine") and setting the value to localhost, I was able to circumvent whatever was blocking the call. See the below screenshot for clarification.</p>

<p>I am now happily debugging my extension without hassles.</p>
