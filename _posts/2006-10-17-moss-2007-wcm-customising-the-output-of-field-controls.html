<p>I've been looking at SharePoint 2007 from a Web Content Management perspective, and the first thing I want to know is how do I customise the HTML output. When displayed to the end user, rendering is validating XHTML should not be made complicated.</p>
<p>Customising the layouts doesn't always mean the default output is invalid, just that's not not what you want. Best example is a heading TextField - you want to surround it in<br />
<h1></h1>
<p>, but ONLY if it has content - empty tags not only look messy, they cause <a href="http://commontags.com/2006/05/26/ie7-still-duplicates-text/">rendering issues</a>.</p>
<p>Having run into <a href="http://richardszalay.blogspot.com/2006/10/moss-2007-changing-default-welcome.html">several </a> <a href="http://richardszalay.blogspot.com/2006/10/moss-2007-background-colour-cannot-be.html">other </a> problems, I was determined to resolve this one.</p>
<p>And I did, but unfortunately no single fix covers everything. One of the most important things I have discovered is that the major field controls, like RichLinkField and RichImageField, do NOT store structured data; it's just HTML. This means that you can't have access to the URL portion of the field.</p>
<p>Below are the common field controls and a sample of modified output:</p>
<h3><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms473978.aspx">TextField</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms574428.aspx">RichImageField</a> and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.publishing.webcontrols.richlinkfield.aspx">RichLinkField</a></h3>
{% highlight html %}
<spwc:FieldValue runat="server" ControlMode="Display" />
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note the use of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.publishing.webcontrols.editmodepanel.aspx">EditModePanel</a> to stop the inner FieldValue control from causing an exception when going into edit mode.</p>
<h3><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.publishing.webcontrols.richhtmlfield.aspx">RichHtmlField</a></h3>
<p>I currently have not figured out a way to template the output of the RichHtmlField. Should anyone else attempt this, I'll cover what I've tried/learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>RichHtmlField ignores the DisplayTemplate (and Template) property.</li>
<li>The CustomTemplate property is ignored by most, if not all, field controls.</li>
<li>Internally, RichHtmlField overrides the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.basefieldcontrol.renderfieldfordisplay.aspx">RenderFieldForDisplay</a> method and renders the HTML out directly, which explains why it ignores the template properties.</li>
<li>TextField throws an exception if assigned the FieldName of the RichHtmlField (even if the RichHtmlField is removed from the page).</li>
<li>RichLinkField renders nothing - most likely because the regular expressions it uses to parse the HTML internally aren't matching anything. This also applies to RichImageField as it is a subclass of RichLinkField.</li>
<li>FieldValue, like RichHtmlField, overrides the default rendering process itself - meaning that templates do not work with it.
</li>
</ul>
