<p>MSDeploy (WebDeploy) is a great technology, albeit one with a steep learning curve and a severe lack of available expertise. It's also something I'm probably going to be blogging more about, since I've been spending a lot of time with it of late.</p>
<p>I've chosen to go with the Web Publishing Pipeline (WPP), the MSBuild layer on top of MSDeploy that first shipped with VS2010, as my goto setup simply because of the integration with MSBuild (Item's particularly come in handy).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. There's a number of MSDeploy features that are simply unavailable in the current release (VS2010 - v10.5 / VS2012 - v11) of WPP. I'll likely be blogging about these limitations, as well as anything else that comes to mind, in the coming weeks.</p>
