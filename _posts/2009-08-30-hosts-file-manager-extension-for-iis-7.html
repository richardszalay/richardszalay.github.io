<p>I've just released the first version of my new side project, the Hosts File Manager extension for IIS 7. The extension does pretty much what it says on the can, providing a user interface to edit the local hosts file from within IIS Manager. Running from within IIS gives me a few other benefits, too, like auto-elevation and providing me easy access to local website information.</p>
<p>For now, there's only a global view (accessible from the default "server" view in IIS Manager), but I have more features planned for future releases. You can read about these on the <a href="http://iishosts.codeplex.com/">Codeplex project page</a>.</p>
<p>To download it, head over the <a href="http://iishosts.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=32195">Downloads page on Codeplex</a>. I've released both x86 and x64 versions, but all my testing has been done with the x64 installer (since I'm running 64-bit Win7). Please log any x86 or Vista issues with the <a href="http://iishosts.codeplex.com/WorkItem/List.aspx">Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
