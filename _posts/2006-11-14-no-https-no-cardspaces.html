<p>It was like I was back in my first days of programming more than 10 years ago; I tried to implement CardSpaces on a sample page and nothing would work like it should. I click a button and the form submits without loading the CardSpaces selector. I even copied the HTML from a <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/infocard-demo.php">working sample</a> into my own, and STILL no CardSpaces love.</p>
<p>HTTPS...</p>
<p>Yeah, without HTTPS the CardSpaces UI will not show at all. Honestly guys, would adding a "The CardSpaces internet explorer plugin could not initialize because the connection was not secured" message have been that hard?</p>
<p>Even worse, my dodgy OpenSSL-generated certificate does not appear to be good enough:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cardspaces-badcert.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now, I <em>know</em> there is a debug mode for developing a relying party without having to buy an IIS cert for my development machine. There IS a debug mode, right Microsoft? RIGHT!?</p>
