<p>One annoying problem I've noticed in the past is that if an exception is thrown in Application_Start() the application does not restart, resulting in subsequent requests going through to the application (aspx pages and other handlers) without the Application_Start() actions happening. This can be particularly annoying as the errors that result on the pages of the site do not tell you why Application_Start threw an exception to begin with.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a simple solution, and it involves using <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpruntime.unloadappdomain(VS.80).aspx">HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain</a>. If you call UnloadAppDomain the application will reset and the next request will start it up again, causing Application_Start to occur again. This will allow you diagnose the error that is occuring in Application_Start and thus let you fix the problem.</p>
<p>Below is a sample Application_Start method:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{
 try
 {
  // Some important startup stuff that must happen
 }
 catch
 {
  HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain(); // Make sure we try to run Application_Start again next request
  throw; // Rethrow whatever was caught
 }
}
{% endhighlight %}
