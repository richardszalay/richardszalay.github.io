<p>This problem has got to annoy at least someone as much as it annoys me:</p>
<ol>
<li>You close a Web project and open another than has a similar folder structure</li>
<li>You attempt to create a folder that existed in the previous web project but not in the new one.</li>
<li>Visual Studio tells you that the folder already exists</li>
<li>You swear and delete everything in c:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\VSWebCache\[ComputerName]</li>
<li>You close and open the project</li>
<li>You create the folder</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve this annoying problem, I came up with an EnvironmentEvents macro a while back that cleans up the VSWebCache folder when you close a solution that contains a web project. To implement, paste the code below into a EnvironmentEvents macro module.</p>
{% highlight vb %}
    Private PerformCleanup As Boolean

    Private Sub SolutionEvents_AfterClosing() Handles SolutionEvents.AfterClosing

        If (PerformCleanup) Then
            Dim psi As New ProcessStartInfo("cmd", "/C rmdir /Q /S ""%homedrive%%homepath%\VSWebCache\%computername%""")
            psi.CreateNoWindow = True
            System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(psi).WaitForExit()

            psi = New ProcessStartInfo("cmd", "/C mkdir ""%homedrive%%homepath%\VSWebCache\%computername%""")
            psi.CreateNoWindow = True
            System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(psi).WaitForExit()
        End If
    End Sub

    Private Sub SolutionEvents_BeforeClosing() Handles SolutionEvents.BeforeClosing
        Dim isWebProject As Boolean = False

        Dim prj As Project
        For Each prj In DTE.Solution.Projects
            If (prj.Properties.Item("ProjectType").Value = 1) Then
                isWebProject = True
                Exit For
            End If
        Next

        PerformCleanup = isWebProject
    End Sub
{% endhighlight %}
