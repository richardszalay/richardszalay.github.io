<p>I ran into a scenario recently whereby installing Web Deploy didn't create the <em>WDeployAdmin</em> and <em>WDeployConfigWriter</em> users. After attempting to uninstall/reinstall a few times, to no avail, I ended up configuring the users manually. Here's how I did it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create local users <em>WDeployAdmin </em>and<em> WDeployConfigWriter</em>. Since you won't need the passwords after this process, I recommend using a complex password (like via  <a href="http://strongpasswordgenerator.com">strongpasswordgenerator.com</a>)</li>
<li>Disable password expiration on both accounts to avoid issues in a few months time</li>
<li>Add <em>WDeployAdmin</em> to the local Administrators group</li>
<li>Open %windir%\system32\inetsrv\config in explorer and grant <i>WDeployConfigWriter</i> write permissions to it (ignore the permission denied error on config/schema)</li>
<li>Open IIS and select "Management Service Delegation", which is at the server level (not on a site)</li>
<li>For each item with <em>WDeploy*</em> in the User Name column:
<ol>
<li>Select the row and click "Edit" (or double click)</li>
<li>Click "Set" next to "Identity"</li>
<li>Re-enter whichever user was set as well as the password you generated earlier</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything should be fine after that. If deploys are still failing, check out the "Web Deploy" event log.</p>
