<p>There's something about the new System.Net.Mail classes that has been annoying the hell out of me. I appreciate that the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> is more complete and that I can finally send emails with embedded images, but there's something that it does less well.</p>
<p>What annoys me is that System.Web.Mail (or more specifically, the COM objects it was using) automatically generated me a text version of my HTML email. Granted the text version was terrible, but it was a text version nonetheless.</p>
<p>I know I can add alternate views to my email for HTML/text, but I use Serialization/Xslt to manage my emails and I don't want to maintain two separate Xslt's just so I can have a text version of an email.</p>
<p>The result? I've had to integrate support to my TranformMailer generic class to create a text version of an HTML email. I'll post TransformMailer once I've cleaned it up a bit.</p>
