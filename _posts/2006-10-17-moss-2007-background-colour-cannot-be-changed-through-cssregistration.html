<p>Thanks to the order in which CSS files are registered and then rendered by the CssLink control, our good friend core.css (/_layouts/1033/styles/core.css) will always override your background color with background-color:#FFFFFF; (line 7).</p>
<p>Usually I'd recommend using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#important-rules">!important</a> to keep the background, but unfortunately Internet Explorer 6- doesn't support it properly.</p>
<p>To resolve, it unfortunately means adding a manual  or  after the CssLink control.</p>
<p>Also, those behavior attributes (core.css: line 12, line 1973) won't pass validation so I hope they don't render to the end user. Don't make me come down there Microsoft.</p>
