<p>So I finally got around to looking at vector's in the AVM2 yesterday (for asmock) after someone logged a bug and found that the Flash 10 features are not actually documented in the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/avm2overview.pdf">AVM2 Overview</a> document. Fortunately, after some digging around, I uncovered enough to implement support. Here's what I found:</p>
<p>References to a typed generic type (Vector. as opposed to Vector.) are referenced by a new multiname kind (0x1D), which I call GenericName. GenericName has a format like so:</p>
<pre>[Kind] [TypeDefinition] [ParamCount] [Param1] [Param2] [ParamN]</pre>
<p>Where:<br />
[TypeDefinition] is a U30 into the multiname table<br />
[ParamCount] is a U8 (U30?) of how many parameters there are<br />
[ParamX] is a U30 into the multiname table.</p>
<p>Obviously generics are not generally supported yet, so ParamCount will always be 1 (for Vector.).</p>
<p>The other interesting thing is how instances of the class are created. A new opcode was added in Flash 10 (0x53), which I will call MakeGenericType. MakeGenericType is declared with the following stack:</p>
<pre>TypeDefinition, ParameterType1, ParameterTypeN -&gt; GenericType</pre>
<p>It also has one parameter, a U8 (U30?) specifying how many parameters are on the stack. You will generally see MakeGenericType being used like this:</p>
<pre>GetLex [TypeDefinitionMultiname]
GetLex [ParameterTypeMultiname]
MakeGeneric [ParamCount]
Coerce [GenericNameMultiname]
Construct [ConstructorParamCount]</pre>
<p>So if you had the following...</p>
<pre>GetLex __AS3__.vec::Vector
GetLex int
MakeGeneric 1
Coerce __AS3__.vec::Vector.
Construct 0</pre>
<p>You would now have an instance of Vector.</p>
