<p>The <a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=34&amp;g=6&amp;i=1526">replacement</a> for the FTP service in IIS 7 is almost here, and it's looking better everyday.</p>
<p>Although still only a release candidate (RC0), the new service supports a myriad of new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>FTP over SSL</li>
<li>Membership Providers</li>
<li>UTF8</li>
<li>IPv6</li>
<li>(Significantly better) User folder isolation</li>
<li>Hostname support (ie. multiple sites on the same port)</li>
</ul>
<p>The FTP service can also be added as a module to a website, logically binding a website to its FTP site.</p>
<p>In addition, FTP also brings the <a href="http://www.iis.net/articles/view.aspx/IIS7/Managing-IIS7/Using-FTP-Server-in-IIS7/Configure-IIS-Manager-Authentication?Page=2">IIS Managers Service</a> to the table. The IIS Managers Service is basically an IIS specific <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sx3h274z.aspx">membership provider</a> that allows creation of users with access to modify an IIS Website or upload to an FTP but without having a windows user counterpart (which means they can't log in to the machine.</p>
<p>I for one am looking forward to the day when IIS7 is commonplace amongst hosting companies.</p>
