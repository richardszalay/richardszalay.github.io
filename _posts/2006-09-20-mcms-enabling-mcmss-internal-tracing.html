<p>When more complicated problems with MCMS arise, I was finding myself wishing I could enable tracing to MCMS rather than go to support to solve the problem. Eventually I ended up using <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> and finding the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.switch.aspx">Switches</a> MCMS uses internally. Being that none of these switches are documented anywhere else online, I thought I'd share the knowledge.</p>
<p>There are 3 Switches in total:</p>
<dl>
<dt>CmsAuthTraceSwitch</dt>
<dd>Trace messages related to authentication and authorization (I find myself using this one most often)</dd>
<dt>CmsCacheTraceSwitch</dt>
<dd>Trace messages related to node caching. Strangely enough, I have never enabled this one</dd>
<dt>CmsGlobalTraceSwitch</dt>
<dd>Trace messages related to everything else</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please note that these are all <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.traceswitch.aspx">TraceSwitches </a> and therefore need a value attribute between "1" (just errors) and "4" (verbose)</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone out there who is having trouble with MCMS</p>
