<p>If you try to execute a Powershell script from a CruiseControl.NET build on a 64-bit OS, you'll get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>File ~filename~.ps1 cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.</blockquote>
<p>If you google around, you'll be told to execute <strong>Set-ExecutionPolicy</strong>. Unfortunately, on 64-bit, that won't fix your problem.</p>
<p>The issue is that CruiseControl.NET is 32-bit and the default powershell on 64-bit Windows is 64-bit. When a 32-bit process accesses SOFTWARE registry keys, the request gets redirected to <strong>HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node</strong>. This results in powershell looking for the wrong key and thus getting the default value.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, execute the following at an elevated command prompt:</p>
<pre>%windir%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"</pre>
<p>In finding this solution it prompted me to realise that, in 64-bit Windows, <strong>c:\windows\system32</strong> is 64-bit and <strong>c:\windows\SysWOW64</strong> is 32-bit. And then my head exploded.</p>
